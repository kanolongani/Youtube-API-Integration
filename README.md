# Youtube-API-Integration
My project is a website that utilizes the Flask web framework and the YouTube API to provide users with a search bar for finding videos. The website retrieves information about the top 40-50 videos related to a user's search query, including metrics like views, likes, and comments. It offers a user-friendly interface for easy navigation
